                    <p class="Text">I coded the classic game of Snake where the snake grows its body by eating the apple that is on the map. The main objective of the game is to consume as many red apples as the player can to acheive a high score. However, as the snake grow, it becomes much harder to navigate the enclosed map. If the snake collide with itself or the sides of the game, its Game Over. If and when the player loses, the game can be reset to play again. Made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    <p class="Text">In this program, an array is defined with preset values. The program prompts the user to enter an integer to look for in the array using a Binary Search. During the Binary Search, the value searched is compared to the middle element of the array. If the value of the element is smaller than the searched value, the left half of the array is omitted and then the program continues searching for the element within the right side of the array. However, if the value of the element is larger than the searched value, the right half of the array is omitted and then the program continues searching for the element within the left side of the array. This process continues until the searched value is found within the array, or until there are no more valid comparisons to be made.

                    <p class="Text">With this program, I simulated some everyday use cases that an ATM undergoes within an average day. This program was written in C++ with the iomanip and iostream libraries. On execution, the program asks for a PIN to login, if the user does not enter the correct PIN before they run out of attempts, the program terminates. However, on a successful login, the program continues. Within the program features a few different options that the user can type and interact with the program. The user can see their current balance, make a deposit, withdraw money, or exit the interaction. In addition, the output is formatted with the given libraries and output to the interactive terminal.
